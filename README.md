# Food Truck Project

##Description 
	This program was designed to have the user create 5 food trucks. The user inputs the name, food type, and rating from 1-5 for each food truck. All of the users input is encapsulated to ensure any changes made do not affect the original data already input. The user can input up to five trucks but if they only want to input 2 trucks total then the system allows for that by having user input "quit" and program follows up with a menu from them to choose from. 
	
	The program has 5 menu choices to choose from.From listing each food type, seeing the average of rated food trucks, displaying highest rated food truck and quitting the program. User is giving the choice that they have chosen
